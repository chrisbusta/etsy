"title": "Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrel Bolt Action Bullet Pen in Gold, Gunmetal, Copper, or Chromel Finish with Velvet Pouch",
"description": "This beautiful pen is handcrafted using Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrel Oak and is available in Gold, Gunmetal, Copper, or Chrome finish. Also included is a nice black velvet gift pouch.\n\nThis completely irresistibly fun Bolt Action pen will be hard for any hunting or target-shooting enthusiast to put down. Every detail, from the bolt action mechanism to the precision engineered components, was carefully designed to ensure uniqueness and reliability. The realistic bolt-action handle smoothly advances and retracts to securely lock the refill in place. The pen comes with one ink cartridge in black ink. Parker style refill&#39;s are available at WalMart, Staples, or Office Depot.\n\nMy Jack Daniels items are made from white oak barrel staves from authentic Jack Daniels charred oak whiskey barrels used for aging whiskey. The whiskey is aged in these barrels and then the barrels are salvaged and disassembled for the staves.\n\nA Certificate of Authenticity will be included with each Jack Daniels item purchased. \n\n \n\nFinished size: 5-1/4&quot; long.\n\nJACK DANIELâ€™S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product.\n\n\nPlease check out all my Jack Daniels products at:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PensPrintsAndThings?section_id=15976969&ref=shopsection_leftnav_1",

During the throwing process I alter the form by denting and stretching the surface creating areas for your fingers to rest nicely. This particular blue/turquoise is a combination of three glazes that create a subtle variation throughout the cups surface.\n\nThe glazes on these cups are exceptional and of the quality I would submit to a gallery. The small speckles you see are micro crystals caused by the cooling cycle I program into my electric kiln creating a very smooth and matte surface. I hope that these cups are as much of a joy for you to use as they are to look at.\n\nAll of my pots are dishwasher and microwave safe. The glazes I use are 100% food safe and lead free. Everything is entirely handmade by me in my studio in Southern California.",

These are set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel",

"policy_shipping": "Standard orders in the US ship in 3 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 6-8 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade-  Typically 5-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (6-8 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!",

"policy_additional": "It is important to include all requested info needed to complete your order.  Missing information will likely delay your order shipment.  Design changes or capitalization requests must be stated separately at check out.  Abbreviations are made where necessary. \r\n\r\nProofs are available at no charge based on request!  Please note a &quot;PROOF REQUEST&quot; on your order at check out if interested!  Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;",

Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

"description": "This one of a kind table lamp is fashioned from a weathered and aged 1940 Taylor Electric Mfg Co. circuit breaker box ( it says London & Canada on the brass label plate) with African mahogany (Ipe), and an old flex filter from a whiskey still. The classic font and cool look of the 1930s and 1940s exists on this electrical box. The flexi  goose neck of the filter makes a fun upper half of the lamp. It&#39;s an homage to times past using all reclaimed parts. The lamp stands 25&quot; tall and the base is 6&quot; x 8&quot;. The toggle switch on the box operates the lamp. SalvageConstruct plans to produce many more fun historical art furniture, so please keep an eye out for us. Thanks for taking the time to look at my pieces and have a great day. If you have any questions feel free to send me an email. I have several more pieces coming soon so keep checking in. Thanks for the support.",

"description": "Whiskey By The Fire Bottle Cap Balm Scent Sampler\r\n\r\nWhiskey By The Fire Smells Like:\r\nGreen moss, foliage, with warm masculine spice. Very popular scent!\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you feel like your beard is a bit out of control, tame it down with American Gentleman Beard Balm! These bottle cap samplers are great if you are new to American Gentleman, or if you are unsure of which scent you want to buy. These samplers are made in bottle caps, with enough balm to use a few times depending on the length of your beard.\r\nAmerican Gentleman Beard Balm has a waxy texture that will help you gain control of your whiskers and allow you to shape your beard to your liking. Moisturizing oils & butters in the beard balm will also soften your facial hair and smooth out the rough texture. Beard balm works best for guys with longer beards.\r\n--------------------------\r\nHow to Use Beard Balm:\r\n1. Scrape a small amount out of the tin with your finger\r\n2. Warm the balm in your palms by rubbing them together\r\n3. Work the balm into your beard, starting at the ends and working your way up to your chin and neck\r\n4. Smooth and shape your beard to your liking\r\nThe beeswax in the balm will help keep those wiry hairs in place while the oils soften and condition your beard and skin!\r\n--------------------------\r\nThis Product Contains: Beeswax, Grape Seed Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Jojoba Oil\r\n\r\nIf you have an allergy to any of these ingredients DO NOT USE.

"policy_shipping": "Kustom Products Inc is happy to ship anywhere in the world, as long as your part of the world allows my products!\r\nAll items are careful packaged with love using as many recycled products as I can. \r\nAll items have a 1-2 week turn around time not including shipping due to the time it takes to customize each piece.\r\nBoth domestic and international packages are shipped USPS and FedEx at this time.

Also please note that any buyers are responsible for any Customs Fees, taxes, tariffs, or other duties incurred.\r\nTracking is always included!\r\nPlease note that some countries will hold packages coming in from out of their country.

"policy_refunds": "All personalized items are nonrefundable as they cannot be resold.  If your item is received and it is incorrect or damage please contact Kustom Products immediately so we can fix the problem and get another item out to you right away. ",
"policy_additional": "I accept custom orders!  Do you have a design in mind? Give me a shout!\r\n\r\nAll artwork, reproductions, and images on https://www.etsy.com/shop/KustomProducts are copyrighted (c) by Kathleen Cheever. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nCommon Questions:\r\n\r\n1. How long until I get my products?\r\n\r\nProcessing time for all items is 1-2 weeks. Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create.\r\n\r\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\r\n\r\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received. If you need an order rushed, the order will be fulfilled after hours so to not effect the order of the other items. Please note that part of the rush processing fee is the cost of an employee working after hours.\r\n\r\n3. What are the extra fees and why are there extra fees?\r\n\r\nThe extra fees will very by item. Some of the extra fees could be:\r\n-Priority Shipping-based on the amount and weight of the item along with where the items need to be shipped to.\r\n-Rush Processing-Please understand that EVERYONE needs/wants their items as quickly as possible and one customer&#39;s item will for NO reason be placed in priority over another customers item. Because of this all rush processing orders are filled after hours or on weekends and will occur and rush processing fee. All rush processing fees will be in the range of $10-$100 depending on the size of the project and how quickly the items are needed.\r\n\r\n4. What mail carrier do you use and how long will it take to receive my items once they are shipped.\r\n\r\nAt the current time my main provider is USPS with very few packages being shipped out FedEx. USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\r\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\r\nAll other items 2-9 days\r\nPriority items 2-3 days\r\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\r\nFirst Class Mail 5-16 Business Days\r\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\r\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\r\n\r\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times\r\n\r\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \r\n\r\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\r\n\r\n6. Do you accept returns?\r\n\r\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items.  Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial.\r\n\r\n7. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\r\n\r\nCancellations on items will be accepted within a 24 hour time period as long as the item has not been currently worked on or in production. Currently worked on or in production items also includes any custom items that included mock ups/proofs. Due to the time constants of mock ups/proofs these items are considered &quot;in production&quot; and cannot be canceled once started. All items that have not been started but are passed the 24 hour time limit will be given as credit of funds towards the shop for a future purchase within 265 day from original purchase date.\r\n \r\n8. Do you do proofs/mock ups/pictures of your items?\r\n\r\nDue to work load I do not do proofs/mock ups/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day I get 25-50 requests for such items, the average mock up/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 2-17 hours a day. If you would like a proof/mock up/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed.\r\n\r\n9. For custom Images:\r\n\r\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that most .png images will not be acceptable. \r\nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $25-$50 or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site.\r\nThe cost of a custom item after the black and white vector is received varies on the size of the image and the item the image is to be engraved on. Cost range from $2.50 per item to $40 for large items. If you are looking for multiple items for a company or another occasion discounts for large quantity orders will be given.\r\nAll vector images need to be sent to Kate@KustomProductsInc.com because Etsy does not currently support vector style uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Why are the silver flasks more expensive then the other flasks?\r\n\r\nThe silver flasks cost more then the other flasks due to production costs. In order to produce the mark on a silver flask a marking agent must be used. The marking agent is a very expensive spray that reacts with the heat of the laser.  After the marking agent is placed the item that is being marked the item must be marked at a high heat and at a very low speed that takes 4 times longer then other similar items.\r\n\r\n11. LAYAWAY: I know that wedding budgeting can be tricky and sometime it is just easier to pay a few payments then one lump sum. For that reason layaway will now be available on purchases of $250 or more.  Please read the following rules carefully:\r\n-Layaway is for purchases of $250 or more. If you would like layaway on a purchase less then this please contact me and I will see if something can be arranged.\r\n-A 10% layaway fee will be added to the cost of your order. For a $250 order this would be $25.\r\n-Layaway payments can be made by credit card via Etsy and/or PayPal. No checks or money orders will be accepted.\r\n-There will be no refunds of money for any lawaway purchases. All money that is currently paid to the shop can be used as shop credit only minus the layaway fee.\r\n-1/3 is due on purchase, 1/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 60 days\r\n",
